### Firebase Configuration

The application requires Firebase configuration files that are excluded from version control:

- `firebase.json`: Firebase project configuration
- `.firebaserc`: Firebase project aliases

To set up these files:

```bash
# Install FlutterFire CLI
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

# Configure Firebase
flutterfire configure
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (not tracked in git) for any additional configuration:

```env
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
```

## 💻 Development

### Running the Development Server

```bash
# Run in Chrome
flutter run -d chrome

# Run with hot reload enabled
flutter run -d chrome --hot

# Run in release mode
flutter run -d chrome --release
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

2. **Enable hot reload**: Press `r` in the terminal or save files to trigger hot reload

3. **View logs**: Check the terminal for debug output

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Sensitive Files Excluded from Git

The following files are excluded from version control for security:

- `firebase.json` - Firebase project configuration
- `lib/firebase_options.dart` - Firebase API keys and configuration
- `.firebase/` - Firebase CLI cache
- `.firebaserc` - Firebase project aliases
- `firestore.rules` - Firestore security rules (if containing sensitive logic)
- `firestore.indexes.json` - Firestore indexes (if containing sensitive data)

### Best Practices

1. **Never commit sensitive data**: API keys, credentials, or configuration files with secrets
2. **Use environment variables**: For any configuration that varies between environments
3. **Review Firestore rules**: Ensure proper security rules are in place
4. **Regular security audits**: Review dependencies for vulnerabilities
5. **Keep dependencies updated**: Run `flutter pub outdated` regularly

### Setting Up for New Developers

New developers should:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Set up their own Firebase project or request access to the development project
4. Run `flutterfire configure` to generate `firebase_options.dart`
5. Configure `firebase.json` with their Firebase project settings
